// A one-semester project for Kinamtics in Fall 2017

// The author wrote all the code for the group of four students.
// Panayioti created and ran the Solidworks portion
// Hunter and the other person handled the reports and data checking.

// The goal of the project is to run kinematics, dynamics, and joint 
// force analysis on a four-bar linkage system.
// This is a simulation of a joyride for children.
