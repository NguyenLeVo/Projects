This is to document all of my works during and post college.

In the MATLAB folder contained the Joyride Analysis project, and a question-based System Dynamic project.

In the C folder contains games and programs I have created. Notably there's a speller checker program

In the Python folder contains programs I have created.

This is to be constantly updated.
