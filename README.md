# This is to document all of my works during and post college.

## In the MATLAB folder contained the Joyride Analysis project, and a question-based System Dynamic project.

## In the C folder contains games and programs I have created. 
Notably there are:
- A speller checker program 
- An image processing program with grayscale, sepia, blur, reflect, and edge detection

## In the Python folder contains programs I have created.

This is to be constantly updated.
