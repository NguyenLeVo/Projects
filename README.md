## This is to document all of my works during and post college.

### Below are some of my interesting projects.

### In the MATLAB folder:
- [A Joyride Analysis project](https://github.com/NguyenLeVo/Projects/blob/master/MATLAB/Kinematics%20Project/Final_Project.m)
- [A System Dynamic project](https://github.com/NguyenLeVo/Projects/blob/master/MATLAB/System%20Project/System%20Project.docx)

### In the C folder: 
Notably there are:
- [A speller checker program](https://github.com/NguyenLeVo/Projects/blob/master/C/2020-04-11%20Speller.c)
- [An image processing program with grayscale, sepia, blur, reflect, and edge detection filters](https://github.com/NguyenLeVo/Projects/blob/master/C/2020-03-30%202%20Image%20Processing%20-%20Filter.c)

### In the Python folder:
Notably there are:
